Question:

What does the following error message tell you?

(pasted from course)

SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

Answer without looking:

Without looking at the solution, I would suspect that the code was defining a hash-set
or other structure which utlizes curly-braces (iterator, loop, etc) and 
encountered a closing parenthesis instead.

This could just be an issue of simply forgetting to close the hash-set
