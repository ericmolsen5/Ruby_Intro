What is the value of a, b, and c in the following program?

string = "Welcome to America!"
a = string[6]
b = string[11]
c = string[19]

It appears that we are creating single character strings. I'm assuming that all
string references behave like the C language and are actually integer arrays
under the hood with a null value as the last character. Let's see:

**before irb check**

a = "e" 
b = "A"
c = This should be Ruby's String version of an index_out_of_bounds exception. 

**answer from irb**
Correct, except Ruby doesn't halt the program with an error/exception, 
it just returns nil if the index is out of bounds.

I'm used to a harsher syntax checker (Java).
