You run the following code...

names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

...and get the following error message:

TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

**Pre-check answer**

An array can only accept integers as index values. Ruby is trying to implicitly convert
the string value to a single digit, but a string is an integer array under the hood.

This would be appropriate for a hash set where key values are allowed to be strings, but
not for an array. An array is one contiguous block of memory at run time and the index
is the computer's queue on where to jump to within that block.

Give the second line an integer to fix this:
change:
names['margaret'] = 'jody'
to
names[3] = 'jody' or use an array library call to locate this value in a large array
