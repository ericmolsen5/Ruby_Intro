How do you return the word "example" from the following array?

arr = [["test", "hello", "world"],["example", "mem"]]

**before looking at solution**
- The easiest way that I can think of would be an array index reference of [1][0]
- We could also use an array search method, but since it's a 2D array, this might become complicated.

**after looking**
- Ahh, I forgot, arr.last.first would also work. There are many ways to do things in Ruby.
