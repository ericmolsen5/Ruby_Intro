What does each method return in the following example?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)

2. arr.index[5]

3. arr[5]

*************

1. Returns the index of the first occurence of the integer 5. Answer: index 3

2. Generates an NoMEthodError. I believe this is looking for a single element array of 5.

3. This returns the value at index 5 which is 8
