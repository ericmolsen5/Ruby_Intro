What does the each method in the following program return after it is finished executing?

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x.each do |a|
  a + 1
end

This method should return the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 since iterators begin with an index of 1 rather than 0.

Oops. Incorrect answer.

Variable 'a' does not print. If launched in the irb, the each iterator method will return its iterated object.
This is what iterators will always do in Ruby.
