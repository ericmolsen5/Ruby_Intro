What does the following error message tell you?

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

Answer (without looking):

I would assume that a method was called which takes two parameters, but only one was
provided by the calling method. 

You could fix this by providing a default parameter value...although I'd be careful 
with this as it's an easy way to creep into run-time bugs. Remember, the compiler
is your friend and he smacks you out of love and concern.
