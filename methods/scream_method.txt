Question:
What will the following code print to the screen?

def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  return
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

Answer: This method should do nothing since we explicitly returned an empty line.
        Commenting out the explicit return should provide the method's expected
        behavior. The method returns nil, but prints our expected String value.
